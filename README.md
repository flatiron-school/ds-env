## Environment Files: Machine Learning, Artifical Intelligence, & Large Language Models

* `ml` subfolder for the courses **Introduction to Machine Learning** _and_ **Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn**
* `ai` subfolder for the courses **MLP, Time Series, & Neural Networks** _and_ **Neural Networks & Similar Models**
* `llm` subfolder for the courses **Large Language Models**

### Environment Creation from a YAML file

Depending on the machine that you are working on, run this code:

`conda env create -f [NAME].yml`

in your terminal/prompt after activating `conda`.

*  `Conda` [documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) can be found here
    * Scoll down to "Creating an environment from an environment.yml file"
*  When running the above environment creation code, make sure you are in the same location as the downloaded YAML file

*Make sure to replace `[NAME]` with the appropriate ending for the file depending on whether you have a PC, `win`, Mac with M silicon chip, `silicon`, or Mac with Intel chip, `intel`.*
